The human brain is probably already somewhat primed for sparse representations and the "privileged basis". At the very least, there must be some balance between the information density trade-offs of superposition (as a toy model, N binary neurons can represent N things to 2^N things depending on how distributed the "code" is) and the energy/long-range communication cost of multi-neuron representations
