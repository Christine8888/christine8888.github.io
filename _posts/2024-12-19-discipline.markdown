I thought it might be useful to write down my current mental model for discipline. In general I think discipline as a virtue is overrated; the times in my life when I thought I had the "most discipline" were actually times where I was motivated by feelings of indadequacy or self-punishment. I've been trying to view self-discipline as grounded in self-love, and also only rely on discipline as a force to overcome activation energy towards goals I know I have intrinsic motivation for, rather than as my primary fuel.

I model discipline a fundamental trait represented by a single vector, whereas every discipline-requiring task can have its own "perceived difficulty". To be concrete, assigning difficulty levels 1 to 10: let's say that waking up at 7AM is a 2 for you and a 8 for me, whereas doing a math problem set feels like a 3 to me and a 7 to you. Then even if one of us is much more disciplined than the other, you will tend to execute more on waking up at 7AM, and I will tend to execute more on doing my problem set. I think this is sort of contrary to popular wisdom about discipline, where certain behaviors absolutely corresopnd to discipline/lack thereof. Both perceived difficulty and overall discipline are situationally variable and can probably be trained.

In my experience, being disciplined in certain parts of my life -- eating well, exercising consistently, doing hard work -- tends to make it easier for me to be disciplined in other areas, too. I think having more routine not only reduces the "perceived difficulty" of routine tasks, but also also raises my overall discipline bar. I imagine this has some connection to dopamine regulation dynamics?
