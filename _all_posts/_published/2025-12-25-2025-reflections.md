Merry Christmas! This is approximately the one year mark from when I started writing on this page, although really with the spring/summer hiatus this is barely the 6 month mark. I had an amazing year!! I took a bunch of lovely trips with my stars (San Diego, Tahoe, Maui, New York x2, Palm Springs, Napa, Paris, Berlin, Sequoia NP), listened to great music (including the best live shows of my life -- Tame Impala and Fred Again), went skydiving, dressed up a million times, danced a lot, laughed even more, met so many incredible new people, made up many new phrases, stopped bleaching my hair, and became closer to my family.

### Execution
2025 felt very much like an "exploit"/execution year for me. Christina, Jenna and I came up with the (novel, revolutionary) farm analogy while sitting at Tootsie's during week 5: Jenna has been sowing seeds, Christina has been reaping harvests, and I've been tilling my fields. I mean this mostly towards my career and intellectual life. While I think I've done my most interesting and fulfilling work yet this year, I don't think December 2024 Christine would have been surprised by what actually happened: I did the [AI-for-astrophysics project](https://christine8888.github.io/replicationbench.html), took the systems classes (honorable mention to [CS336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/)), joined the NLP group lab, did the [AI safety](https://www.matsprogram.org/) [research programs](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/). The [creative thinking]-to-["do the right thing well" execution] ratios of projects I worked on this year were all around the 10/90 range.

I honestly don't think I have had a true "execution" year before. 2024 for was for sure an exploration year (highlights: trading, SAEs, Berlin); before that I was sort-of sleepwalking in college, and before that I was just doing astrophysics for fun and being a high schooler. So it does feel good to have just really focused on doing the less-than-sexy work of becoming a stronger researcher and engineer, and I'm quite pleased with how much progress I've made in a year.[^clode]

On the other hand, there were many days that I felt every day was the same. I woke up and I pushed projects forward by doing approximately the right thing: reading data, double-checking intuitions, cleaning code with Claude, making the right inferences, setting up the next experiments. Over the summer especially, I felt I had fallen into a stressful monotony, but this improved substantially once I came back to campus. Obviously "doing the right thing and executing well" is how most truly valuable work gets done. But things generally felt lower-entropy, and maybe less grand/cosmically important/fun to think about, than the broad and speculative "thinking about AGI" I was doing December of last year.

It's unclear whether my intellectual life getting "more boring" is a bad thing. On one hand, it feels like I've generally had fewer compelling or creative ideas recently, and am somewhat less motivated to think about grand questions (e.g. the "nature of intelligence", or the "ideal post-AGI society"). On the other hand, it feels sort of ridiculous that I was trying to think about completely new evaluation or training paradigms, without the execution ability to back it up. Maybe this is just Dunning-Kruger? I have always generally biased towards liking big, elegant ideas, so I hope to revisit those "grand questions" in due time with more empirically-grounded creativity.

### Life and practice
I will be calling anything that involves regular and compounding effort over sustained periods of time a "practice". I think I would be very happy if my life consisted mostly of practicing fulfilling things with great people and in high-entropy spaces.

The flip side of having an "execution" year has been that most of my other practices (writing, music, puzzles, even general wellness) have suffered. I tend to have strong preferences about work patterns (i.e., being uninterrupted for many hours at a time, and finding it hard to stop and "state dump" mid-chain-of-thought). This meant that the "greedy" choice was often to do as much work as possible, allowing interruptions for my sleep and my social life. But I think even if it was net better in that very moment to skip a run or eat a random meal or not write about an idea day-of, I look back on 2025 and wish I had invested more into my practices.

There are also new practices I've been wanting to develop and have not really prioritized. These come from background instincts or desires that have persisted for a while (~several months?), some picked up mimetically, although most do feel pretty authentic:
- Hosting; I used to host a lot in high school (house parties, I guess), and all but stopped after freshman year at Stanford. I'd like to be a great host of low-stakes, feel-good things. ZAP Creative Sundays will start in February?
- Physical creative work: Even after making the dress and taking the design class, I still don't feel like I've really gotten to the core of this. I want to learn glass blowing and wheel pottery and wood carving![^coffee]

### Adulthood
I turned 21 this year! I think I'm always more unceremonious about birthdays than I expect of myself -- maybe it's because I have a summer birthday[^summer]? But I did have a beer at Constellation.

In spring I thought I might not come back to Stanford for senior year. I did end up enrolling for the fall, and although I only took two classes and spent most of my time on research, I think just being on campus improved my life significantly.

- Peer group: I had leased a place in SF over the summer but realistically was in Berkeley most days to be at Constellation, while most of my friends were in SF or on campus. Now that I'm back on campus, I live across the hall from two of my best friends. I also reliably bump into people I enjoy being around but am not close friends with ~every day, and especially (since we're seniors) at pre-organized events. It is extremely nice to have my social calendar taken care of, and to have community at ~zero cost.
- Other things to worry about: Over the summer I often (every ~other day?) felt quite stressed about how my research was going. When I came back to campus I started working on a couple of other projects and also spending more time on my classes. I think having many interesting lines of work going on at once helped me be less stressed about any of them, individually or in aggregate.
- General feelings of limitless possibility: Intellectually I know that "real adults" change their careers and life trajectories all of the time, but it is so much easier to feel like "the world is your oyster" as a student! Concretely, we pick a full slate of new classes every 10 weeks, there's always something interesting to do with friends or student organizations, and you can join or create a new, high-commitment, well-resourced community (clubs, labs, affinity groups...) at any moment. It does feel like as long as I am at school, there is no waveform collapse; I could still do anything next quarter.
- No downside: Usually I hear people want to drop out because they find classes and on-campus opportunities are worse than real-world, full-time ones that school might distract from. I might not really want to take classes anymore, but doing my Fellows and other projects at school is only positive for my quality of life. 

I still feel *not that excited* about no longer being a student. Without the structure, schedule, and ecosystem energy of campus, it seems easy live a low-entropy, low-community life by default; there are probably also higher returns to agency, but the average gradient also seems stronger. As a student, I also always have a diverse plate of demands (at any moment multiple classes, projects, social obligations) which, for me, balance each other out and prevent any from becoming all-consuming, especially because my schedule is always interleaved. In theory I'd like my work to be all-consuming, at least in phases, but I think my default experience of "all-consuming work" is also stressful to the point of being counterproductive, and I think it will take significant effort to avoid this. 


### Miscellaneous
- Lots of complex things feel magical to me! There is the magic of systems you understand, or know you could understand, and yet it is just beautiful that it works at all (the Internet, the formation of mountain ranges, etc.). But there is also the magic of systems which feel unintelligible, the "magic" which gets assigned to cargo runways and bogeymen and prayers for rain. I think it is agency-suppressing and dangerous, both for individuals and for society at large, to feel too much of the second form of magic. I have noticed in myself that certain concepts (e.g. kernels, before I started writing them) take on the second form of magic, and thus the idea of an "unfixable kernel bug" feels terrifying. I have had to remind myself there is truth and signal under ~everything.
- When I step away from focusing on execution, I feel vast uncertainty about what I want to do "next". I have this sort of meta-desire -- desire for desire -- and a general feeling that I should have more conviction and discernment. I actually often feel envious of people who always seem to have strong conviction in something; I had the most intense conviction I've ever had around this time last year, thinking about how I wanted to work on superintelligence and alignment and the future of humanity, and now this has just dulled a bit[^AGI].
- I have been feeling faint omens of future health issues (i.e. my knee hurts randomly?)! So this year I have really felt the importance of proactively preserving my functionality for the long haul.
- I still feel super young. I suppose that's a great thing and that I'll look back in decades and wish to feel that young again, but I think sometimes it's a mental blocker 
- It has become more and more of a no-brainer to spend money on experiences: skiing (my most expensive hobby), trips with friends, concerts, great food. I have been effectively price-insensitive on most trips I took with friends this year, and much more down to e.g. fly to another city for a DJ we love.

### To 2026!
Some open questions going into next year:
- Should everything I enjoy doing just have the status of a "practice" in my life, where I build room into my routine and try to improve over time?
- What are the personal impacts of my "job" being increasingly automated? If we already feel like Claude Code wrappers now, what about December 2026?
- Let's call "valence range" the breadth of "how we feel" towards something (clothing, places, people, ideas, etc.). I think I intrinsically have a pretty low valence range on many things, but I don't necessarily want to -- I'd rather feel very strongly about a smaller number of things, which I direct the lion's share of my energy and agency towards. I think this would be both simplifying and amplifying for my life. Is this intuition right, and is there a way to steer myself? Or is there some part of my "valence range" that's getting masked by other things (e.g. fear)?

Some things I'd like to do more of next year:
- Meet people, especially in random and spontaneous-feeling ways
- Become differentially close with people I really connect with! Sometimes I struggle with meeting many people, becoming friendly with all of them, and not deepening any connections in particular; here specificity/narrowness and depth feel like they come together
- Build community around the low-stakes things I enjoy (does anyone want to start a crosswords club?)

[^clode]: Part of my growth has been on the high-level planning side (how to design this sytem, how to construct this paper), but I would attribute maybe 50% of my increase in sheer output to being better at using better agents.

[^summer]: It seems like there are ~15 prime years to have a summer birthday, which are roughly ages 20 to 35. Anytime you're a student, if you have a summer birthday it's likely only some fraction of your friends (presumably mostly your peers from school) are in the same place as you; freshman summer I spent my birthday completely alone since I was in Hilo that summer, although I had a great day cliff jumping and eating acai bowls over on Oahu. As an upperclassman friends might travel for your birthday (we always do for Catherine, since it coincides with July 4th), and freshly post-grad your peer group tends to be consolidated geographically. Then once your peers start having families of their own, suddenly people are gone for large swaths of the summer again!

[^coffee]: The cynic in me feels like this could be my version of "wanting to open a little coffee shop in Portugal": some idealized escape fantasy, which we imagine to be glamorous even if the reality would not be. Hence the [Coffee Beans Procedure](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/face-it-youre-a-crazy-person?utm_medium=email). I do think I'd like to learn about clay sourcing, though.

[^AGI]: partly due to focusing on executing, and partly due to longer timelines/takeoffs, which reduces my sense of urgency
