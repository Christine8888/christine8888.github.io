Congratulations on your great decision! Berlin is maybe my favorite city in the world, so I'm very jealous.

Overall tips:
- If you're at all into performing arts, *get the ClassicCard*! You pay your age (in my case 20€) and get unlimited access to 10-15€ arts tickets, and you can bring an U30 guest. I went to 11 different shows (ballets, theater, orchestra, opera) during the quarter mostly with ClassicCard tickets. 
- Take a light courseload. I know everyone gives this advice -- I got this advice and still considered doing 17 units -- but 12 units was absolutely the right choice. It was really nice to not really be worried about homework or finals. On weekdays sometimes we'd be on the move (class, shows, dates, exploring the city, long group dinners) from 9AM to midnight with very little downtime, to the point that U-Bahn was the best time to do ~20 minutes of German homework.
- Try to get to know someone from your cohort before arriving. Abroad is an amazing time to meet people and I made amazing new friends in Berlin, but coming into the program already knowing people really helped with the adjustment.

CLUB REVIEWS:
- Watergate: the first club we went to. Touristy vibe and sort of boring music, so we never went back. It's very historic (been around for 22 years) but unfortunately it closed at the end of 2024.
- Tresor: the tourist techno club? Pretty much anyone will get in, and the music is good. Super fun venue, with smoke and flashing lights everywhere.
- Sisyphos: lives up to the hype! Definitely dress colorful, the whole place is carnival themed and there are fun little Easter eggs to explore everywhere: outdoor stages, duck lasers, colored disco balls, random cabinet-sized rooms, even a Chinatown(?)-inspired hallway. The main bouncer always has a fun outfit going on -- last time it was a pink suit with flamingo motifs
    - 3 rooms playing music non-stop Friday to Monday: 1 techno (Hammahalle), 2 that are more disco/house-y
    - I imagine it's even more fun in the summer, since the club has a massive and beautiful garden section. Unfortunately it closes from December to February, when even with the heat lamps it's too cold to sit outside.
    - We went twice and never had any issues with lines/getting in, but we always went early (~11PM). I recommend going at an off-peak time since you can always sit and eat/smoke inside, and once you get the stamp you can re-enter the whole weekend for 5€
    - Kind of a trek to get to, but it's next door to Dark Matter which has an amazing permanent experimental light installation + fun seasonal DJ sets, so try to combine your visits if possible
- OXI: we went for Halloween and had a great time. Good music, fun smoking/garden area (although it gets really cold), nice elevated surfaces to dance on.
- KitKat: Berlin's sex club! Go with an open mind, go with the flow, and I think you'll be surprised at how fun and liberating of an environment it is, regardless of whether you hook up with anyone. The music is great!
    - Usually ~5 parties per week (MWThFS), there are specific themed events on Fridays like Piepshow and FourPlay that attract really fun crowds
    - We never had a problem getting in, but definitely go early-ish (~11PM) and adhere to dress code. I wore a bodysuit w/ cutouts and tights/fishnets every time, sometimes a skirt for inside. Our guy friends bought harnesses/mesh pieces, and usually had to show outfits at the door. People tend to go all out for KitKat, and I think leaning into the dress code is actually a lot of fun.
    - Go with people you feel comfortable with. That being said, on our final Friday ~15 people from our cohort ended up in KitKat together and it was hilarious.
- OST: fun for very fast (>140bpm) techno. When we went the main room was only playing hardstyle! Also, you can stand/dance on the speaker boxes lol
    - Check RA Guide before, sometimes you have to pre-buy tickets, but the ticketed line usually moves pretty fast and they generally don't bounce people.
- RSO
- Berghain:
