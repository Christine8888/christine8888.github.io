In hindsight, I was very fortunate that gravitational-wave astronomy was the astrophysics sub-field I happened to stumble into some 5-ish years ago. Although gravitational waves are a natural corollary to Einstein's General Relativity, which is well past its hundred-year anniversary, actual gravitational waves were first detected in 2015. So I had the fortune of being in a young, rapidly expanding, well-funded field of research, in which the rules were still being written and the possibilities were seemingly endless.

I believe I benefited from what I'll call **environmental equity**. This riffs off the traditional concept of equity in an asset or corporation. Imagine you work at a startup that undergoes massive growth; you benefit from this growth because the value of your equity increases.
