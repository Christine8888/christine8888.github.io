This contains a rough sketch of my thoughts on J.D. Vance being Trump's VP pick. I may or may not come back to write this in more detail.

- J.D. Vance -- Peter Thiel / Alex Karp -- Elon Musk
	- The Stanford *Review*, the Girard Society, Hoover Institution (international relations), pro-Israel movements on campus and around the world
- *Efficiency above all*
	- Move fast and break things -- freedom to build AI, trade crypto, take down institutions, create their vision of the world
	- Techno utopias/techno optimists, who may even be left-leaning/socialist
		- Effective altruists; Karp being a socialist; *there is no cognitive dissonance* because techno-optimists genuinely believe that the best thing they can do for the world, and for all people's well-being, is to build more technology
		- Strong vision that tech will be good for everyone; Paul Graham's *Cities and Ambitions* -- Silicon Valley respects power (to affect everyone) & products -- a self-reinforcing feedback loop
		- "Elite charade of changing the world" (good book)
        - A strong interest in *the greater good*, i.e. using fossil fuels to build AGI/ASI to solve climate change
	- Tech billionaires will be fine no matter what happens (gay marriage, climate change, etc.) -- much less *risk averse* for immediate issues, much less willing to buy into identity politics
	- Libertarianism over partisanship
- Disillusionment with "mainstream liberals"/the Democratic party
	- "Cancel culture", lynch mobs, strong leanings towards anti-wokeness
	- Slowness and inefficiency of existing institutions (especially in SF; one of the most liberal and also chaotic cities)
        - Anti-wokeness was a big big deal, although wokeness is kind of past its prime now, at least in America 
	- Either a ton of interest (in a pro-military way), or zero interest, in protecting global democracies/Western ideals (v.s. being able to freely do business w/ Russia, China, etc.) -- especially when it hurts interests at home (Populist ideals)
        - Ton of interest: Palantir, Scale AI, & adjacent. Little to no interest: Sam Altman (raising $7T from Middle East dictators), etc.; sometimes Russia, Middle East is OK but China is usually off limits
