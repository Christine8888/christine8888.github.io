Welcome to my blog ("Christine's musings" for now since I couldn't think of anything better). I hope to force myself to write down more of my ideas, although I can't make any promises about the quality. I don't even know if I expect, or want, anyone to read any of this. But I think there's something to be said for the keyboard as an instrument of distillation.

Some things I hope to write about
- Artificial intelligence: my research, my bets, interpretability, alignment, startups, geopolitical competition, what an AGI/ASI world can and should look like
- Scientific research, epistemics, generally meta ideas about science
- Side quests
- Media I find interesting
- My life (tastefully)
