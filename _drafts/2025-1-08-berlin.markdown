title:  "Notes from Berlin"

From September to December 2024 I lived and studied in Berlin. I learned the basics of German (*ja, ich spreche Deutsch*), lived independently in the city, clocked ~35 hours in Berghain, spent noctural weekends powered by U-Bahn station croissants, and saw unfamiliar parts of both the world and myself.

To call it educational is an understatement; it was transformative. I think through the stark contrast with my "normal" life at Stanford, living in Berlin amplified the personal evolution I've undergone in recent years. It was *so* refreshing to be removed from the intense landscape of campus (and broader SF) -- ambition-obsessed, workaholic, often judgmental or at least anonymity-free -- and to have the *breathing room* to grow. I also relied on my "when in Berlin" mentality to justify, or push myself towards, risk-taking and unfamiliar-feeling adventures.

I miss the city, I miss the love, and I miss the tiny, transcendent fraction of spacetime occupied by the people we became.

I. on "normalcy", personal plasticity, and situational selves

II. on the joys of self destruction and construction

III. on flirting with extremes

IV. on self-expression and the good life

V. on subjective sensation and the chasm of understanding

VI. on berghain
    - the impact of techno
    - how i felt while dancing 
    - community
    - contrastive acceptance
    - 

ideas:
- upload all the berghain videos to google drive. also embed one
- 

i think a) generally being removed from campus/SF/the US + living independently for an extended period of time sort of gave me the breathing room to process a lot of things b) being in a different culture and really trying to buy into it was very fun and i think allowed me to try on more different versions of myself as well and c) generally i had a very like yolo/"when in berlin" mindset and hence doing more things/taking more risks
i think like the first 5 weeks i was very much like wow this is so fun and im in a new city and i love exploring and not really worrying about my work, and then the last like 6 weeks i was like wow i actually feel like profoundly different

things i learned in berlin
- all clubs should have cost check and camera stickers 
- normalcy and desensitization; the world you experience and perceive as normal is deeply fragile; it’s an entirely different thing to internalize societal constructs
- my identity is deeply tied to my environment — paul graham cities and ambition — this is not necessarily a bad thing
- flirting with extremes is generally healthy
- transient spaces, community 
- basal emotional nodes, profundity is a drug
- i like art that surprises me and pushes the parameter space of normalcy
- ignorance is bliss but you should never choose it; you have a choice in how experiencing the extremes permanently affects you
- how strongly people feel
- personal aesthetic expression
- bootstrapping language from nothing
- if enough people think something is cool, there is probably something to it

lessons from abroad
- complete independence
- making sense of a culture/language completely foreign — a world coming into focus
- how to feel things viscerally
- the freedom and liberation of berlin’s techno scene
- cultural norms of “acceptable”/“weird” are arbitrary and limit the fullest lives we could live
- that many of my fears (i.e. substances) are unfounded; that the benefit of the new experience is worth the risk
- what it’s like to be an “outsider” in a community 

berghain:
- kindness
- automatic acceptance

berlin christine:
- did drugs
- was sexually freer
- was a lot more open minded
- felt deeply liberated and fun
- felt true joy and connection with her berlin friends
- really liked engaging w her learning/ classes
- enjoyed feeling totally unjudged and unruled
- felt a deep appreciation for the arts (music, museums, dance)
- was pretty secure in her independence
- realized cultural relativism
- felt really deeply bonded to catherine + others; felt the peaks of love and empathy
- felt free
- unburdened by work / existential dread
- OK with risks (as long as her friends were doing it)
- got really into the idea of spiritual transcendent experiences and being instruments of something greater

things i’ll miss
- trying to order in german at restaurants
- learning new words from the sign
- climbing into my bunk bed
- smiling at strangers in berghain 
- all the cute shops on my street 
- walking to dinner and lunch 
- so much more casual leisure — pool bars, saunas, theories markets, cooking chestnuts on the frozen wannsee
- being really fluid in my identity self expression and aesthetic


Bh diary 12.8
my fully sober klubnacht
the bag checker remembered my lock screen from last week
dancing with ballet guy, he told me to come back later, i ask how long he’s staying, he says till the end
ballet guy is sooo fun he’s been a regular for 10 years, i love moving my full range of motion through my fingers 
Mischa is such a sweetie with his pink hat 
my last dance and last klubnacht
israeli gay couple __ our pano besties
people dancing with one another as far as the eye can see
pano — fun, disco, vibrant, vibey, twirls and shimmy
berghain — wild, animalistic, violent, head banging, bass through the body
sitting in eisbar with taiyo kai and adrian
having our youthful days in berghain
PROFESSOR GEOFF IN PANO BAR WTFFFF HES SO CUTE
6 stanford students and 1 stanford professor in berghain at 12am on a monday 
taiyo’s so cute
head back lights up face of joy
taiyo shaking ass on the peak
love in my heart for kai who is so down and so fun and says she loves dancing with me
i loveee watching taiyo boogie
kai and i promised it wouldn’t be the last time we dance like this
spoke mandarin to a chinese girl from shanghai
i loveeee watching the floor pulsate under the lights, people throw around their shoulders and bounce their bodies, all facing each other and dancing together, muscles moving as far as the eye can see, light dancing off skin
the DJ at the front of the room, lasers shining from above,  a full floor of people moving like their life depends on it
i want to take a video so bad but i know the atmosphere is dependent on it not being captured
new light installation — cables hanging down in a twisted vine from the ceiling 
we all share in this religious and transcendent sensory bodily experience together
it’s like sober molly — i feel the greatness of movement, the overwhelming love and gratirude
20fps flashing lights — stop motion dancing
i’ll miss the freedom to be completely expressive with my body and completely feel the music
pano — you float on the high notes 
rainbow jockstrap guy in pano
having too good of a time tn to stop
jack from australia maybe hitting on me lmao invited me to ket 
vietnam guy that i danced w across the dance floor
absolutely fabulously dressed people — silver zebra jumpsuit
seeing adrian smile and dance
adrian saying “we will dance forever like this” and surrounded by a blue fog haze with his arms up in a silhouette
outfit: 3 space buns, white skirt, blue bikini top, black platforms LMAO
honestly maybe the most pure and liberating and exhausting fun i’ve ever experienced
there really is friction and contrast on the dance floor 
i love the feeling of both collective and anarchy 

i’m overwhelmed by love (12.2)
i love how free i am right now
i love how i dance i love how i feel the music i love how happy i am i love how funny and fulfilled i feel in my social life
i don’t want to lose all of this in the hustle and bustle and industrialization of stanford life
i can’t imagine what my life would’ve been like without berlin
it combines my long love for music and dance with the power of collective love and spirituality 
it’s just as special to feel it in my own body and feel the hours slipping by as it is to see the crowd move
community is so important, people at berghain show up and show out every week, tipping, dancing together, bringing water. the amount of love floating through the air 
your love and empathy are set by the baseline around you

i’m newly interested in the qualitative sensory and emotional experiences, sparked by shroooms + my drugs lmao. i think it’s insane and also amazing that i will never know how someone else’s mind feels 
i think the drugs have given me more awareness of my emotions sensations and mind. 

it feels like i’m rediscovering joy from first principles and from the base emotions
 it feels amazing to dissociate and to lose myself in the music
the no phones and the door policy is crucial

so much of this shit is just chemicals (12.3)
we will never really understand the subjective experiences of others
feelings and intuition are the truth — rationalists are just hiding to invent their own meanjg
i feel love for everyone around
i feel like im ina. bubble 
being scared of drugs is fixed mindaet
a
short cut to the meta view of your sensations and mind

i just felt such love and joy and admiration for the space and for all the people around
the music felt all encompassing and i loved to twist and sway and let it flow through my body
so many kind people — the waterf fairy, sharon topless, balcony ballet guy, natalie from amsterdam, accidentally rizzing straight guys, that guy who twirled me, korean lady, pano girl, ketamine tattoo guy, etc 
the music feels like an infinite ride, a canvas for my movement but also the muse
3mmc + molly night
in my white tennis skirt dancing around on the stage
i put my arms up and feel like the music flows into me from around
sitting on the couch with adrian just talking about our transformations this quarter
just feeling pure good and movement
I really worried that i would regret rolling and sleeping at 5 before a full day of class + final exam, but it was all fine and i was actually more energized than i expected
“people always love christine in the club” -adrian 

i loveee my friends kai catherine adrian i love our dynamic i love that we all laugh together i feel so comfortable and loved and able to be myself 

i had a lot of memories of hayden during my trip but i think i realized i never truly loved him. i saw visions of us in the oregon house and in arav’s tesla but i can’t tell you anything about him, only my innocence and love for the moment

my favorite moments in berlin
- laying down on the couch in sisyphos with my friends
- the closing hours in panorama 
- listening to rachmaninoff in the dark sunset gray long shadow hours in my room
- completely aping out in the berghain main hall

from before:
- jumping into the cliffside sea coves in mallorca and on milos 
- ATVing around the island
- bites of spinach pie between naps on the boat 

And i realized it’s totally possible to think you know everything — that morals and standards are arbitrary, that life is meaningless — and convince yourself that you’re playing the game, when really you’re living in fear. What kind of life is it if you only constrain yourself to the things you think are normal? if you won’t even sweat in a club or be naked in a sauna? it’s like theory and practice — just because you can articulate an idea on paper does not mean you can live it
but to what extent do we create self fulfilling prophecies by articulating experiences?

writing about techno
- nostalgia for a perhaps bygone era of complete freedom; who would i have been? a fascination with anarchy
- the ability to disassociate, to lose myself. phone free and judgment free spaces that only live on in our memory
- a small patch of resistance and joy in the relentless march towards efficiency and brutality of the rest of society. a perhaps transient community— like roxy 
- to shed appearances, to lose yourself completely, to feel completely safe and yet surrounded by a transcendent sensory experience. it’s almost like solo hiking — embracing the dirt, the humanness, the crudeness of the experience. and i think my favorite experiences in techno have been alone or just with one other person i trust
- i think i am very easily switched to new reward functions, and techno is an all inclusive scene. new fashion, new music, new hobbies, etc.
- it’s tribal, it’s animalistic, it’s a prison of rhythm — but it’s also completely safe. complete freedom to express yourself knowing a) the things around you  are equally wild and b) the beat is your rock. music and feeling stripped down to their core
- i think it too me by surprise how much i liked techno. and sometimes it surprises me how deeply i get sucked into it. it’s not a feeling you can prescribe or plan for
- i keep looking for that dissociative feeling — “wow look how weird all these different parts are” — and i just don’t get it  
- i’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to live in berlin and truly go on this journey of discovery. 
- there’s so many layers of the music to notice and to follow 

from 11.15
how do we construct our subjective reality?
1. by letting the greatest experiences we have be information hazards; by adjusting to new and ever higher standards 
2. by using the extremes as an opportunity to understand and experience the limits of what’s possible; by taking those insights and searching for the sparks of greatness in every  other iteration

i think i battle extreme curiosity for the extremes, nostalgia for feelings of the past, and heavy fear/anxiety around my mental place 


sometimes the light hits and it feels like the room goes on forever
people look SO GOOD dancing
it’s literally fucking OBSCENE how good this is like i would scream at certain drops
actually craziness
full body animal movement 
letting completely loose
surrounded by sensation
the haze is only retroactive
loosing yourself is an onion of layers
literally the best fucking experience like how clubbing in the movies felt like i can’t imagine anything better
we’re all apes
i physically can’t move as hard as im being commanded to
why tarnish the pure music with words or voices?
this shit is addicting i just want another bump of the full body sensation 
sweat dripping into my eyes

i had a lovely balcony ballet/go crazy sesh with some random guy that looked to be 50
techno is enjoyable even if you’re not familiar with it — you have the steady beat to count on and to frame your experience around
berlin rewired us (fashion, hotness, etc)
this whole place feels really alien 
can’t tell if i’m hallucinating screams of joy 

the feeling of going absolutely nuts
screaming at the drop
dancing with my space hun self shadow
chosen by the laser

U always have some apeshit in u it just takes coaxing
My whole life has been about theory and practice 

Purity of the experience — berghain is top notch — long long dissociations and dance sessions uninterrupted 
So many smiles — the community is automatically putting a good foot forward — many new friends
If the music is really good you don’t need a substance


that society naturally tends towards catering to the preferences of the wealthy
that the truest culture and feeling usually comes from those who can’t afford the rising rents
that it still takes technological growth and economic prosperity to have the kind of excess that berghain represents
maybe all these spaces are transient
gwern’s essay on subculture 
a transitory space — abandoned buildings on the border strip, administrative chaos, the space to create a new scene — still exists somewhat today, i feel the embers of the wildness and anarchy of the 90s. also the drugs were really important — ecstasy as the drug of togetherness

My room and personal life are a mess
18 hours clubbing this weekend

The feeling of the music surrounding you
dance coursing through your bones
crazy movement 
Crowd around you going wild
Room stretching on for infinity
Arms up air free

New friends all around
going topless! thanks to sharon and her glitter
a guy giving me a hug in panorama for having such a beautiful vibe 
dancing up on the stage
my “iconic” solo entry —> recruiting kai adrian and taiyo
genuinely screaming with joy at the music
being crusted all over with swear
the most delicious apfel schorle and vanilla ice cream
ears ringing for a day straight after 
seeing some random older asian girl (could’ve been like 30-40?) and becoming dance floor friends
at some point we got a (broken) fan 
just staring at the setup — the red lights, the concrete walls, the dungeon vibes and hanging chairs — and being mind blown that this is my real life and a real place
an hour of elation just that i got in
the blue laser was my spotlight — i was loving looking at my shadow doing my punching the ground dance and i look up and one of the room’s 6 beams is directly above me 
just the decision to do space buns. a random stroke of inspiration from above
learning to rave more functionally over time i.e. lulu shorts, fanny pack, water bottle 
just feeling my body — the jelly of the air as i wiggle my fingers at the music’s peak
the urge to dance harder and harder to match the music — literally throwing my arms and head and stomping my legs
the music is a force that commands you to dance and pulls you in from the sidelines. once you get “on board” you are at the mercy of the rhythm and the drop. the beat is reliable, unrelenting, the backdrop for a surreal trance and addictive movements 
being exhausted, physically spent, in pain, but still feeling the urge to dance. waking up the next day barely able to walk
adrian tells me he loves that i’m always down to rally and dance and stay out, and that when he sees me dance he can tell i really really feel the music like he does

You can read all the theory and journals and writing you want but that’s mainly in support of those who get the message already. There is no substitute for feeling it for yourself and once you get it indeed the words that others have articulated are correct but the articulation itself could never have brought you to the truth
I think the whole world just feels more visceral and real to me now. The sensations are real. I’m not performing for anyone


i think i’m a more fun and free and open minded person now than i ever was before and i hope i can continue on this train of self liberation.
i used to love ballet class because i liked the pain, i liked the feeling of getting better, and i liked the beauty of lines, but now i feel like i love dance in the purest sense. the joy of movement — with other people — and being surrounded by movement and lights 
i think i have always had a strong appreciation for aesthetics and for sensory experiences
the 80s hate to see you coming -catherine


it’s insane how much structure comes out of like ~100 degrees of freedom
it’s crazy to think about the mechanics of it and how you get the illusion of the group from individual movements 


psychedelic coke

why would you live life prudish? prescribed? limited?

Sometimes you just have to get deep into it
sometimes the journey is pre defined and the discoveries/milestones are shared; other times it’s unique
you just have to accept the waves as they come
don’t prescribe and don’t expect


i feel like my hedonism journey has been maturing this whole time
that i had to buy into certain privileges and treats and joys in order to get closer to my basal urges and primal feelings
that it was a slow progression of new sensations
that i finally feel the things i used to think i “should” feel — in sex, in learning, in music, in dancing
that i followed my desires deep into the wilderness and discovered the well spring of instinct 

I’ve lost my sense of shame at least in solo/1on1 settings 

Metamorphosis
of shapes
of music
of movement

How many paths to reach the surface of the movement box?


sometimes the music is the imperative 
the friends the catalyst. house calls for a partner techno is more sol
house is flesh techno is bone
the journey taken through time and space and feeling
unique every time

in berlin i learned how to improvise 

everything is manual
autodidacts live harder?


splash around in the puddle of thought but don’t get so deep you forget which way is right side up

dance as topology 
a ladder 


i wish i had the physical vocabulary to express the music fully
substances don’t create the experience they enable it

Insane times in panorama
Riding the music unable to escape the flow
Compulsory movement 

 I realize I have a pretty high tolerance for the absurd and for the uncomfortable and when I was at kitkat last night, I felt actually not taking all of everything that was going around me to see so many humans in their elements of self expression


So much excess
No phones
Disco balls and flashing lights and purple trees
Dancing in the cage
Hair whipping, jumping, pole dancing 
Beautiful skin and people
