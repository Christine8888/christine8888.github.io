*Not a bullet journal in the aesthetic, Pinterest way, just a journal in bullet points*

- (1.6.25) isn't it amazing that every social network has its own emergent, niche social norms?

- (1.5.25) pictographic languages are much harder for new learners to bootstrap (think phonetics in Chinese vs. English); the compositional space of symbols with literal meanings is only so large. maybe pictographic languages must evolve ~slowly at first, s.t. symbols are sedimented before the language is extended to higher levels of abstraction

- (1.3.25) two career thoughts. (1) it's hard to *force* a career that makes use of your comparative advantage; not every "intersection" is fruitful. (2) choose work you would do at every stage of the prestige/compensation/"coolness" ladder, not work where only the best outcomes feel desirable

- (1.2.25) the best way to balance rationality with empathy/"normalcy" is to approach everything with humility. be deeply curious about but not above anything; irrationality is a neutral behavior

- (1.1.25) happy new year! my main intentions for the year are (a) authenticity (b) epistemics (c) creation

- (12.31.24) is there any real truth to [taste](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/friendly-and-hostile-analogies-for?hide_intro_popup=true)? how would we actually test "primitives of taste"? this is related to convergent vs. divergent experiences of experts (see lower). or, is it just authenticity and alignment with the zeitgeist (i.e. the brat album)?

- (12.31.24) someone should write out the anthropology of progress and the way technological growth has been felt culturally

- (12.31.24) people act the way they act because of how the world feels to them; on one hand we may never understand subjective perception and on the other hand that is all there is

- (12.29.24) the path to any good *agent*/labor-replacing product passes through the "exoskeleton" phase (IDE, platform, etc.); the action traces & proprietary knowledge are right there

- (12.29.24) self-expression is our most basal form of freedom. also, specificity is deeply tied to authenticity

- (12.29.24) losing track of how many "you should think about AGI/ASI" conversations I've had this winter break

- (12.26.24) in general, a fulfilling and spiritually healthy life involves the growth and then relinquishment of attachments, the transition from active participant to content but passive appreciator. we undergo education, build careers, and nurture families, until eventually our prime years for earthly rewards are beyond us; then we relinquish attachment to a more selfish world and externalize our sources of pleasure, finding fulfillment in enlightenment, simplicity, or even observation of the world. for example, Hindu *ashramas* break life up into four stages: Brahmacharya (learning), Grihastha (wealth accumulation, expertise, family creation), Vanaprastha (retiring), and Sannyasa (focus on enlightenment). one of the weirder things about AGI/ASI is that it will force ~generations (including mine) to (family life aside) skip rather quickly to the end, without full careers or much opportunity to be *active players* in the world. in a superintelligence universe humans will not be active shapers of fate; it seems like healthy,non-hot-wired-brain happiness must come from enlightenment, detachment, and enjoyment of the universe itself. 

- (12.26.24) I am trying to (a) be more cognizant of my anxieties and subconscious claustrophia and (b) actively lean into them when I think those fears are irrational. More or less exposure therapy. Today it was piercing my ears.

- (12.25.24) what childhood story do your parents always tell? My parents talk about when I allegedly wrote down "Ode to Joy" from ear after hearing it on a Kid's Meal toy

- (12.25.24) it would be unfortunate but poetic if the technology humans create eventually ends up destroying us. The optimistic view: technology is the driver of human progress, the curer of diseases and the bringer of abundance. The pessimistic view: technology is inevitable, the local minimum solution to present problems, and a necessity for survival, but every additional innovation is also a greater prison. A hedonic treadmill and a red queen race againsts ourselves that we can never backtrack on.

- (12.25.24) almost everything is more fun if it has a fast feedback loop; this is how I get into "flow"

- (12.25.24) prestige chasing can never end because the motivation is access to spaces you wouldnâ€™t normally get, thus the end goal becomes unsatisfactory as soon as it is achieved

- (12.22.24) I wish I could go back to when I was 15 and fine-tuning GPT-2 to make Rupi Kaur parody poetry. I wonder why I didn't see all of this coming back then?

- (12.22.24) is economic stability and growth a precondition to social stability? is bureaucracy and over-governance both a cause and an effect of stagnation? bikes and surfboards are much more stable when they have momentum

- (12.22.24) if you are communicating something that may not be received well, you really should care about your image. @Yudkowsky, OpenAI Santa aesthetic, EAs in general

- (12.22.24) are we transitioning from an "inter-generational" to "intra-generational" means of cultural normalization and teaching? as in, are people today "learning" more from their peers (Internet culture, etc.) than their elders?

- (12.22.24) as an exercise, we should all concretely write down (a) our ideal AI future and (b) how we would govern if we were a superintelligence (lol)

- (12.22.24) (assuming slow-ish takeoff, which IMO is the only scenario we should even be really thinking about) someone should be the cultural anthropologist of the AI transition

- (12.21.24) I both feel like there's a hole at the bottom of my epistemics, and also that I basically know ~nothing. I wish I could ingest and process all this information faster!

- (12.21.24) even if I know that because I'm in position X, there will probably be people ~similar to me also in position X, I always fear adverse selection. related: if you're not already excellent, how do you find a {chill run club, casual classical orchestra, recreational dance group} that is still "good enough" to be meaningful?

- (12.21.24) absolute things that bring me joy: learning, solving puzzles, being awed by the Earth, cute human cultures, feeling understood, dancing

- (12.21.24) startups should either be creating the footholds for future AIs (agents, domain expertise, etc.) or imagining the primitives of our post-scarcity human future (interfaces, joyful technology)

- (12.20.24) most of the world operates deeply irrationally, hence there is always a local optimum to be found by applying first principles thinking and rationality. does that really mean we should take those ideas to their logical conclusion?

- (12.19.24) new ideas feel like new eigenvectors, or partitions, or pivot points, for an existing jumble of concepts. you pull up the fabric at some junction and the pieces fall into place.

- (12.19.24) are there domains with "convergent" vs. "divergent" expertise? i.e., given X number of hours of non-normative training/attunement, are you more or less likely to share opinions with your peers? my guess: fields with "ground truth", i.e. science, must be convergent to some extent; fields that are more deeply about idiosyncrasy and taste, such as music or painting, are probably more divergent
