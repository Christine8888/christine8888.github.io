*timeline guesses:*
- AGI: not officially announced until 2027/2028, but palpably here by end of 2025. o5 is undoubtably superhuman at programming and math, RL is working on other STEM domains and maybe even philosophy, multimodal + perception is incorporated, long/infinite context is solved by smarter models, and models are good enough reasoners to learn much more sample efficiently in every domain, including writing or art. 
- Full automation of human labor:[^1] 2032? On one hand the real world is sticky, embodiment/robotics is still a challenge, and it will take a while to build the product stack that enables agents to do real-world work. On the other hand, math/programming being the first automatable work points to faster takeoff. 
- Superintelligence world: 2050? After human labor is ~fully automated takeoff will happen much faster; key markers are colonization of the solar system, the end of illness/death, energy and material abundance. 

*some predictions*
- The transition could be very bad. Here are some things I am worried about, "standard" safety concerns (rogue agents, bad actors, bioweapons, etc.) aside:
    - Arms race w/ China. Hopefully avoidable, especially if models are small-ish and/or ~commoditized, and the international community takes safety coordination seriously
    - Mass wealth erosion or poverty due to automation of human labor without government protection; entrenchment of extreme class division with no social mobility
    - Exacerbation of class inequality/global influence structures due to resource demands and returns from AI investments (particularly hardware)
    - General social unrest due to rapid societal change and need to externalize emotions (see [my thoughts on AI and religion](https://christine8888.github.io/general/2024/12/20/ai-spirituality.html)). We should be concerned that if its benefits are not realized for most of the population, vast swaths will see the creation of AGI as unjust, undemocratic, maybe even criminal?
    - Mass mental health crisis due to loss of meaning
    - Destructive short-circuiting of brains (particularly children/adolescents) thanks to ~perfectly efficient information networks, infinite generative content, addictive and manipulative AI personas, etc.
    - Moral panic or transgressions w.r.t. AI consciousness/personhood
- There will probably be a decades-to-centuries long hedonic transition period, in which we slowly overcome the lesser parts of human nature and also gain a taste for the intergalactic. Probably this can be accelerated with {brain ultrasound? drugs? superintelligent therapy? scientific spirituality? speed-meditation?}. Concretely: we are trained out of needing superiority/hierarchy, conflict, violence, etc., near-death experiences (like extreme adrenaline sports), etc.; everything we think we are losing (working for survival, the existence of ambiguity) is replaced by something greater. We also get acclimated to brand-new sources of pleasure (better art tooling, crisper self-expression, etc.)
    - Hopefully there is not some irreducible primitive part of the human brain that can never reach equilibrium if not under certain Earth-like conditions

If we do get the good superintelligence future, I think these predictions will turn out laughably narrow-minded, but at least they're written down.

*my ideal world*
- Life post-scarcity! Solved scientific theories, all diseases cured, status as a galactic/intergalactic species, an unimaginably good life for everyone
    - I do think faster-than-light will be difficult, so maybe astrophysics/cosmology is not completely solved in the early stages?
- We have a benevolent superintelligent dictator, but it loves humans dearly, as one unconditionally cares for one's parents. I think this is a smooth transition from the world where AI makes ~most decisions and serves as copilot to world leaders.
    - There are laws, perfectly enforced by agents, but the most important law is the equality of all human beings
- Socializing is much better because of (a) mental health/spirituality progress, unconditional love, etc. (b) instantaneous coordination (c) incredible spaces and shared experiences. We are all deeply fulfilled by our friendships and relationships.[^2]
- Through a mix of virtual reality, light-speed travel, and excellent preservation/construction of built environments, we have any experience on demand. Infinite nights in Berghain, lifelike recreations of the Roman Empire, revisiting your own memories, etc.
    - Some experiences will still be contingent on human-human cooperation, but AI-assisted communication handles this
- Although there is no economically valuable labor downstream of education, we learn for our own fulfillment. We have infinitely intelligent and patient tutors, access to the whole of human knowledge, immersive learning environments, and amazing educational tools. We can understand any part of the universe, experience any sensation, and train in every possible hobby.
    - We can choose the adversity level or learning curve (i.e. "instant brain plug-in for perfect surfing ability" versus "highly optimized real-life surfing training") that most suits us; personally I hope to still enjoy overcoming challenges 
- Given how popular Ozempic is, body modifications will be a big thing
- Eventually we are spiritually ready to see the whole universe. We can hike Olympus Mons, ski on TRAPPIST-1e, rave on the rogue planet (PSO J318.5-22), maybe meet aliens?[^3]

[^1]: exception for labor that people specifically choose humans for, i.e. artisans or performers or POTUS. I doubt this will be a sizable fraction of the population before more dramatic things happen.
[^2]: unclear what the solution to monagamous romantic love is. Maybe it there are just higher forms of love? Maybe AI-assisted soulmate dating a la Marriage Pact? Maybe it's *still* unsolvable?
[^3]: the first posters I ever owned were the NASA [Exoplanet Travel Bureau](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/exoplanet-travel-bureau/?intent=021) series. They are still on the walls of my childhood bedroom.
