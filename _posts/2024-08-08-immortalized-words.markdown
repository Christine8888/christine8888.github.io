Everyone knows the age-old adage -- *anything you post online will be on the Internet forever*. Of course, that's not entirely true (solar flares, catastrophic collapses, the need for analog archives, etc.), but it's true enough. So what happens if you're publicly vocal online? If one really believes in *strong ideas held lightly*, then one's digital footprint is a veritable fossil record of thoughts and theories that may have been evolutionarily out-competed.

After STS, I did a handful of media interviews in March/April 2022 that have permanent online presences. There are also photos and articles about me from before then, also about my research. I wouldn't say I'm a public figure by any means, but enough words by and about me are on the Internet that a base LLM can describe me or even auto-complete my personal website (figured this one out yesterday) to some degree of accuracy.

This piece is my attempt to critically evaluate how much I stand by what I've said before.

In terms of research: I stand by all my peer-reviewed published work. I'm not sure how much stock one should put in the research I did in 2019 and 2020, before I had formal mentorship. It's not that I believe formal mentorship is a prerequisite to doing good work -- I still believe the work I did was sound -- but more that, for high school Christine, it helped a lot to have an "adult in the room".

In terms of other media: most of the pictures of me online are very very bad. I'm trying to have forgiveness for my younger self but along this axis it's hard. Please look at my Instagram to see how I choose to present myself now!!

I would listen to the podcast appearances I've done, but I don't want to put myself through hearing my own voice for ~hours.

A quote of mine was featured in the Nature Briefing. I've gone back and forth on how skeptical I feel about the "power of youth", since I think being exposed to bad ISEF projects/bad startups made me really skeptical about bold claims from people without domain expertise. I also think that "have important thoughts" sounds more sarcastic, looking back, than I meant it to sound. But overall, I think this is still a good statement. I really like projects dealing with the "theoretical minimum" (Leonard Susskind, a lot of AI research these days) and I believe that smart, creative people can make contributions as soon as they have enough context.

[GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/seattle-area-high-school-senior-wins-250000-award-for-gravitational-wave-research/) quoted me saying that "Working in gravitational-wave astronomy has been especially rewarding. 'It’s a very young field,' she said. 'It’s really nice to grow up with the field as it evolves.'" I still think this is very true, although perhaps I should have given a little more credit to the people that worked on it before I was even born (and definitely before GW150914). I very firmly belief that the best opportunities will come out of things that are growing -- scientific fields, research groups, companies, global empires, etc.

A couple months after starting college I did an [interview with the Society for Science](https://www.societyforscience.org/blog/five-questions-with-christine-ye-the-1st-place-winner-of-the-2022-regeneron-science-talent-search/). Some things in the article are clearly from my freshman self, like "surfing" or "getting involved in an experimental physics lab". Other quotes of note:
- *"Being a finalist and a top winner gives me confidence that people truly believe in me and my research, and that I have this wonderful community supporting me".* I think confidence has always been a big issue for me, but while STS didn't exactly fix my issues, I do think I'm a lot more secure in my abilities than I would've been without it.

- *"I’d love to work with Kip Thorne! ... I’m continually amazed by how Thorne and other early collaborators in LIGO were willing to take such a big scientific gamble on gravitational waves and maintain their conviction even when most of the broader physics community doubted them."* As of August 2024 I've definitely moved away from working in gravitational waves, so I'm not sure if Kip and I would be the most productive collaborators, but I do still think a lot about scientific risk-taking (and derisking for high-impact projects) and betting on one's beliefs. Fun fact -- my Erdos number is 6 through Kip Thorne (myself --> any LIGO collaborator I worked with --> Kip Thorne, who has an Erdos number of 4), although I'm on the lookout for LIGO folks with numbers < 4.

- *"I’d like to be renowned for using a creative, interdisciplinary and technical approach to making a difference in humanity’s knowledge...  Yet it [astrophysics] allowed me to think creatively about the potential intersections between disparate fields of study — how can we understand astrophysics with artificial intelligence, astrophysics with art, astrophysics with human history?"* I think this quote was actually more prescient than I knew at the time. My sophomore year of college, I spent a lot of time trying to figure myself out -- was I meant to be a pure mathematician, or a quantum engineer, or even an investment banker? But I think this hits the nail on the head. I think great science is elegant and technical but also scrappy, creative, and interdisciplinary, and I hope to do more of it.

- *"Just give things a try! If there’s anything I’ve learned through my scientific research, it’s that you can’t expect anything to go according to plan. But those moments of aimlessness are often where one experiences the beauty of discovery."* I think I need to remind myself of this more, to be quite honest. My summer at Jelinek, for example, was quite the rollercoaster research-wise but I couldn't have been happier with the journey, or even the outcome.

It's entirely possible that I'm anchored by the ideas I've put out in public. I once had a wonderful in-class, live-lecture exchange with Alexander Nemerov, my incredible ARTHIST 1B professor, about the act of performance. Specifically, he expressed the idea that digging up decades' worth of subconscious emotion and rumination on artwork that "called" to him was an act of crystallization, of forcing one to commit to a certain set of ideas in front of a public audience.^ Drawing from quantum mechanics, sometimes I like to think of this act as collapsing an indeterminate waveform. So, it still remains to be seen how much longer I stand by this writing itself.



<sub> ^But, Nemerov also assigned us some readings on vocation (and "the call" in general), specifically Parker Palker's *Let Your Life Speak*. Palmer expressed that his whole life had been spent rediscovering what he instinctively knew since childhood. So maybe this shouldn't be that surprising? </sub>
