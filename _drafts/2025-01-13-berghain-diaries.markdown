*quotes*
*berghain is about love*

*i literally have not felt more like myself ever up until berghain. that place stripped me down to my core*

*community is so important, people at berghain show up and show out every week, tipping, dancing together, bringing water. the amount of love floating through the air. your love and empathy are set by the baseline around you*

*the crowd matters so much. it’s like a transfer of energy something genuinely intangible but connects us all as one to the beat of the track. there is literally no words to describe that feeling. the way we move as one but in our own way. when everyone is dancing together in that dark sexy and wild way it literally makes me feel like I’m ascending into another fucking universe. omg the feeling is so fucking deep i never wanna forget it.*

*the music is a force that commands you to dance and pulls you in from the sidelines. once you get “on board” you are at the mercy of the rhythm and the drop. the beat is reliable, unrelenting, the backdrop for a surreal trance and addictive movements. being exhausted, physically spent, in pain, but still feeling the urge to dance.*

*i wish i had the physical vocabulary to express the music fully*

*i just felt such love and joy and admiration for the space and for all the people around, the music felt all encompassing and i loved to twist and sway and let it flow through my body*

*i love watching the floor pulsate under the lights, people throw around their shoulders and bounce their bodies, all facing each other and dancing together, muscles moving as far as the eye can see, light dancing off skin*
