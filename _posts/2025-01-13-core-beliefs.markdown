*work in progress!*

*on the world*
- people are good, people can be made more good, but society should be structured against collective bad behavior
- the world is created by the conviction of individuals; the world belongs to the ones who care
- everyone should have more fun

*on my life*
- intentional "accumulation of experiences" is core to living a rich life
- free will is the most useful cognitively dissonant abstraction[^1]
- to be "interesting", creative, grounded, etc. nurture your inner world
- intentionally go against your intuitions sometimes, just to check if you're lying to yourself

*miscellaneous*
- I'm a coiner and mutator of n-grams, with lifespans from ~hours to ~months





[^1]: but I also like viewing myself, and others, as instruments through which the universe's greater aesthetic forces can flow. Cheesy, I know
