This post is inspired by:
- In *Sex and the City*, Carrie Bradshaw gets invited to lecture at Columbia in a seminar on the Cultural Zeitgeist
- I've recently become really interested in Alex Cooper (Call Her Daddy), and also lightly in corporate social media
- I saw this terrible post on X where a Startup Tech Bro (TM) told everyone not to worry too much about their product, because Rhode was selling "lip cream and phone cases" for $50+
