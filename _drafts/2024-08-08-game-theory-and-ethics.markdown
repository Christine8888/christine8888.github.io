[INCOMPLETE]

Once, I was having a conversation with one of my classmates about (surprise, surprise) AI and the economy, when he told me, "if this really is a speeding train coming towards the world, then I'd rather be on the train than the tracks."

Also, a couple of open questions:
- If "everyone" is getting fake OAE accomodations (and thus making housing worse for everyone else), how unethical is it for you to also get a fake OAE?
- Did the U.S. have to build the nuclear bomb and end WWII that way, because otherwise someone else (less inclined to global liberal democracy) would've done it first?
- Does the U.S. have to be the first to build AGI, even if it takes enormous acceleration and many an ethical compromise?

My first attempt at answering these questions was through *plausible replacement*: how many players, and with what odds, could actually take your place in whatever action?

collective action, game theory, commitment, problems, social media, and technological revolution. “ collective lockstep away from nash equilibrium”
