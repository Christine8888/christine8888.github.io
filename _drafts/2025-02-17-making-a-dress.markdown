So, I made a dress! My amazing model Catherine debuted it on the runway in Stanford's Memorial Church last Saturday.

*process reflections*

- manual labor & the toil of artists
- the creative process, feeling like an engineer
- not disappointing myself; perfectionism; wishing I pushed myself more
- childhood dreams revisited

"Belief in inspiration. Artists have an interest in others' believing in sudden ideas, so-called inspirations; as if the idea of a work of art, of poetry, the fundamental thought of a philosophy shines down like a merciful light from heaven. In truth, the good artist's or thinker's imagination is continually producing things good, mediocre, and bad, but his power of judgment, highly sharpened and practiced, rejects, selects, joins together; thus we now see from Beethoven's notebooks that he gradually assembled the most glorious melodies and, to a degree, selected them out of disparate beginnings. The artist who separates less rigorously, liking to rely on his imitative memory, can in some circumstances become a great improviser; but artistic improvisation stands low in relation to artistic thoughts earnestly and laboriously chosen. All great men were great workers, untiring not only in invention but also in rejecting, sifting, reforming, arranging." (shoutout Charlie)

The *original* design was primarily motivated by my interest in shapes and physical structure in garments (see the leftmost sketch). I was really interested in chains/jewelry (unsuprising, given that I'd just spent three months in Berlin), and "exoskeleton" garments with shapes and scales far removed from human form. The show's theme was "Metamorphosis", so I toyed a bit with Escher-inspired paintings, and also some lightly transhuman motifs (ribcages made of wire, silver wings made out of metal paper, a wormhole-ish inverse hoop skirt with questionable structural integrity). Also in my original Pinterest board: [Winged Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Victory_of_Samothrace) of Samothrace, the Kafka book, and some playful paper collages.

Anyways, I submitted that design in November for a FashionX internal deadline while I was still in Berlin, and didn't really think about it until I was home after NeurIPS. Over winter break it hit me that I had absolutely zero sewing or construction experience. Thinking about my ability to actually *execute* on a design forced me to pare back some of the more extravagant structural elements, leaving me with the second iteration of sketch. At that point the human-transhuman, ancient-modern motif made its way into the design. This is when I got the idea to have a classic, maybe Greek-inspired silhouette for the actual dress, and mixed-metal wire, chain, and mirror accessories. I was broadly inspired by the "story" of progress, the notion of technology itself as our successor, and how the future [forces us](https://christine8888.github.io/ai-spirituality.html) to reviist human fundamentals; I wanted a design that draped Hellenistic goddesses with modern circuitry.

I made the full chain ribcage, and I bought everything to make the mirror-paper wings, but before I even finished the frame I convinced myself that geometric wings were just going to look aesthetically cheap[^wings]. This sent me back to the drawing board, where I decided that structures (wings, ribcage, headpiece) made of copper wire[^tech] should be the main visual element, placed on top of a plain, toga-like dress. My final sketch liberally borrowed inspiration from [Iris van Herpel's](https://www.artbasel.com/news/iris-van-herpen-dutch-fashion-designer-couture-musee-arts-decoratifs-paris-2024) half-alien, half-biological sculpture-dresses.

Clearly my actual dress retains none of the original sketch, and (generously) is only half faithful to my final sketch. It turns out dress silhouettes are quite hard to get right, so I ended up sewing the skirt off a pattern, since at this point I could barely use a sewing machine. At some point I ditched sketches entirely[^aphantasia], and worked exclusively with physical prototypes, cutting abstract-looking shapes out of the copper fabric and molding the wire on my own face/body. Most elements of the final design came from those late-night tinkering sessions, plus a little Pinterest and a lot of rejection sampling.

I'm very grateful to have had FashionX as both a forcing function for completing this project, and also an incredible venue to display my art. Many of my favorite ideas in this piece were either sparked by conversations with other designers, or distilled under the time pressure of upcoming dress rehearsals. I honestly think I'll design again next year, maybe for myself as the model? even if I'm technically no longer enrolled.

I did about half the design work at home and half of it at school. I really enjoyed working out of Stanford's [d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/), FashionX's venue of choice, which still lives in the historic mechanical engineering and earthquake studies buildings near Main Quad but has evolved into a vibrant and truly lived-in space. The d.school functioned as my 24/7 free[^tuition] makerspace, and also served as a physical source of creative mindspace. Working at the paint-covered tables, sitting between wall-sized whiteboards and sketch sheets, it was really fun to cosplay as a designer. Somehow Huang and Gates don't have that same effect; I want to spend more time in spaces that elicit certain inspirations and pull on certain threads of work just by their physical presence.

[^tuition]: paid for by my tuition, I guess, but who's counting
[^wings]: lol. I genuinely love wings as motifs, and several other designers made amazing wing-like pieces, but I think I made the right choice here. I ditched the mixed-metal idea so the chains never saw the red carpet, but I did wear some of them for a Berlin-themed party on campus
[^tech]: I sometimes lament that my creative process is "tainted" by my research/professional/intellectual life, and that tech-y themes end up being my fallback motif (similarly back when I mostly worked on astrophysics, I ended up making a lot of space/Earth art). But I also think creativity comes in part from familiarity, and I think my final design evolved away from explicit allusions.
[^aphantasia]: I think I have either a mild form of aphantasia, or (despite ~6 years of visual arts training) the inability to translate my ideas to sketches
