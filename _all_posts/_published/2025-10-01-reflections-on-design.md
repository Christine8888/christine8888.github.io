My goal with this post is to capture both short- and long-horizon reflections from taking DESIGN 160. 

10.1.25
- Warming up creatively -- both mentally and technically -- feels essential. I also felt this way on the first day of my choreography class. Unsure if this means that my creativity is being stifled the other 22 hours of the day?
- Today I worked on our first project, *virtual textures*[^texture]. I was struck by how impatient I felt towards the process. I was working on 3.5x3.5 swatches of these intricate, repetitive patterns. Once I had filled in a corner, or sometimes just the initial pencil sketches, it felt much harder to be excited about just finishing the swatch. It was also frustrating that my drawing and mounting wasn't as neat as I'd have liked.
- I've been thinking about whether the toil of creating something from scratch is actually necessary to developing taste and creative autonomy. In other words: if you set aside ten thousand hours to become a great artist (or master any other discipline), are you better off using tools to augment the creation process and getting tons of practice selecting, or should you still be creating entirely from scratch? Does being intimately involved in the details give you discernment that you couldn't learn *just* from training on the judgment task?
- My guess is something like: 1. The process of "handmaking" something is fundamental and unsubstitutable 2. The fruits of this effort are not always aligned with your end goals; it's important to paint your own paintings to develop intention behind each brushstroke, but optimizing arithmetic intuitions probably won't make you a better algebraist 3. How you should spend your time depends on how good your tools are relative to how much time you have to dedicate; training curation without a strong creative foundation is only more sample-efficient early on, but perhaps your tools will progress as fast as you

[^texture]: yes, I have 3 textures due Thursday, thanks!
