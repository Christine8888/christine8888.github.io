The following are the same people, just separated chronologically: {16th/17th c. Renaissance men/Enlightenment thinkers, 19th/20th c. science fiction writers/inventors/academics, 21st c. venture capitalists/Substack writers/founders?}[^1]. Their common traits: polymathic and future-looking curiosity, (often) patronage or wealth independent of vocation, and articulating visions of tomorrow.[^2]

(1) Polymathy and futurism come together. This is because polymaths understand the world deeply among several dimensions, so extrapolating into the future follows naturally, and imagining the future requires understanding the interdisciplinary forces that shape world systems. Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, studied human anatomy, and designed a "flying machine" centuries before planes. Ben Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence, caught lightning, and discussed ["the power of man over matter"](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-31-02-0325) in 1000 years. And in pursuit of understanding civilizational trajectories, modern technologists share a grab bag of other intellectual influences, particularly cognitive science, anthropology, economics, and history.[^3]

I call people of this mold techno-polymaths. Historically academia was the pinnacle of intellectual freedom, housing thinkers like John von Neumann and Richard Feynman. Now the ivory tower is increasingly siloed, its disciplines getting deeper but narrower. So it seems like most of them have turned to creating and/or writing about technology. Why settle for writing science fiction, when you can actually bring that universe to life?

(2) *Progress* is a relatively new idea. The Greeks saw [history as cyclical](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/westernciv/mc_progress/progress_unit2.php), and the Romans viewed history as static (culminating in their empire, *urbs aeterna*); the concept of *continually improving humanity's condition* comes from the Enlightenment, starting with the works of [Francis Bacon](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/). Only post-industrialization has technology (rather than say, religion or moral philosophy) become considered the most powerful lever of progress.

Uniquely modern is the globalized world, the compression of technological timescales, and the relative capital efficiency of (technological) change. Much of this can be attributed to widespread personal computing and Internet connectivity -- i.e., technological progress happening [mostly in the digital world](https://foundersfund.com/2017/01/manifesto/) -- but seems like it will soon come true for the physical world, too[^4]. This leads to the democratization of civilizational impact, and the *consciousness* that compelling visions of the future can be realized through the actions of ~individuals. This sense of *agency over progress*[^5] is relatively new. Building the future has never been more accessible, so technology has become a dominant medium for imagination. And why settle for writing science fiction, when you can actually bring that universe to life?

(3) There are the venture capitalists who invest to capture entrepreneurial value and place smart bets on emerging trends, and there are the venture capitalists who invest to *bring a certain future to life*. For the latter, deploying capital is a means of advancing a philosophical vision, an *active* rather than *passive* thesis that originates from their broader worldview. If the latter are equivalent to history's sci-fi writers and inventors, I suppose the former are more like history's bankers and railroad financiers. An incomplete list following this mold -- *creating* the future through investment -- includes Elon Musk, Peter Thiel (the Thiel Fellowship), Nat Friedman (AI Grant, Vesuvius Challenge), Patrick Collison (YIMBY, Stripe Press, Arc Institute), even parts of a16z (particularly crypto and American Dynamism). Many of these figures were also the popularizers of agency over progress and other ideas in (2).

[^1]: Somehow variants of the essay have persisted through all of this. Also, salons : conventions : Twitter/LessWrong (community focal points) and nobility : academia : philanthropists (patronage).

[^2]: Beyond career polymaths, there exists a growing "intellectual leisure class" that can also read broadly and imagine the future. I think today it consists of: academics, swaths of knowledge workers, arguably anyone sufficiently curious that has Internet access

[^3]: Maybe this can be summarized as "ideas relevant to progress and power".

[^4]: Despite the whole "we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters" thing, I don't think it's wholly bad that we've seen ~30 years of progress happening ~only on computers; maybe building out the digital world was just a prerequisite for the 3D printing, synthetic biology, and AGI-trained-on-the-whole-Internet that will shape the physical world's future. In general technological growth is a flywheel and previous progress enables even grander visions.

[^5]: A (probably overused) Steve Jobs quote that I like: "Everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people who were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use". Or from Paul Graham: "Live in the future, then build what's missing."

[comment]: I've slowly been pulled into using Claude as a sounding pad for my ideas. Having a pretty-smart conversationalist with ~infinite memory for historical events is, unsurprisingly, very useful.

[comment]: **somehow this connects to grantmaking and effective altruism -- combining knowledge with levers of progress
