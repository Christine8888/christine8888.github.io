*Not a bullet journal in the aesthetic, Pinterest way, just a journal in bullet points*
- (12.22.24) [I had a long drive hence all the ideas] 

- (12.22.24) I wish I could go back to when I was 15 and fine-tuning GPT-2 to make Rupi Kaur parody poetry. I wonder why I didn't see all of this coming back then?

- (12.22.24) is economic stability and growth a precondition to social stability? is bureaucracy and over-governance both a cause and an effect of stagnation? bikes and surfboards are much more stable when they have momentum

- (12.22.24) if you are communicating something that may not be received well, you really should care about your image. @Yudkowsky, OpenAI Santa aesthetic, EAs in general

- (12.22.24) are we transitioning from an "inter-generational" to "intra-generational" means of cultural normalization and teaching? as in, are people today "learning" more from their peers (Internet culture, etc.) than their elders?

- (12.22.24) as an exercise, we should all concretely write down (a) our ideal AI future and (b) how we would govern if we were a superintelligence (lol)

- (12.22.24) (assuming slow-ish takeoff, which IMO is the only scenario we should even be really thinking about) someone should be the cultural anthropologist of the AI transition

- (12.21.24) I both feel like there's a hole at the bottom of my epistemics, and also that I basically know ~nothing. I wish I could ingest and process all this information faster!

- (12.21.24) even if I know that because I'm in position X, there will probably be people ~similar to me also in position X, I always fear adverse selection. related: if you're not already excellent, how do you find a {chill run club, casual classical orchestra, recreational dance group} that is still "good enough" to be meaningful?

- (12.21.24) absolute things that bring me joy: learning, solving puzzles, being awed by the Earth, cute human cultures, feeling understood, dancing

- (12.21.24) startups should either be creating the footholds for future AIs (agents, domain expertise, etc.) or imagining the primitives of our post-scarcity human future (interfaces, joyful technology)

- (12.20.24) most of the world operates deeply irrationally, hence there is always a local optimum to be found by applying first principles thinking and rationality. does that really mean we should take those ideas to their logical conclusion?

- (12.19.24) new ideas feel like new eigenvectors, or partitions, or pivot points, for an existing jumble of concepts. you pull up the fabric at some junction and the pieces fall into place.

- (12.19.24) are there domains with "convergent" vs. "divergent" expertise? i.e., given X number of hours of non-normative training/attunement, are you more or less likely to share opinions with your peers? my guess: fields with "ground truth", i.e. science, must be convergent to some extent; fields that are more deeply about idiosyncrasy and taste, such as music or painting, are probably more divergent
