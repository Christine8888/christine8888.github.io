In general I think the [long tail](https://knowingless.com/2016/08/21/421/) of [human experiences](https://www.erowid.org/) is worth exploring. But for the forseeable future, I'm staying away from psychedelics.

*The profundity lever*. Did mushrooms *really* change your life? A psilocybin study showed that [a large majority of participants](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3050654/) rate their trips in the top 5 most personally meaningful experiences of their lives, even many months later. Certainly I think there is some truth to the "revelations", out-of-distribution experiences, discovering of the depths of cognition, etc. that psychedelics (and meditation) bring; those convergent accounts suggest something real underneath. But I've realized that more than anything, psychedelics are pulling your *profundity lever*, flushing your psyche with *feelings* of spiritual beauty that are ~decoupled from your actual thoughts and experiences. Discovery is addictive, and profundity is a drug.

*Short-circuiting the truth*. First, I -- and probably the vast majority of people -- rely on intuitive signals to recognize the truth, even when trying to be "first principles"; when I think, I "compile my beliefs" ("compiler" in the computer sense here). The profundity lever loosens my grip on mental constructs, which can be instrumentally useful, but it disorients my epistemics. Second, realizations that come from psychedelic experiences are generally true, but are narrow tunnels into the mental quagmire and not actual harbingers of clarity. In this sense, over-indexing on trip discoveries can feel counterproductive to the everyday work of maintaining the mind.

*Obsession with interiority*. I believe that the unexamined life is not worth living. I also believe that understanding myself is one of life's greatest challenges and joys. But I think overusing recreational psychedelics might make one *too* preoccupied with interior worlds and subjective experiences. Introspection is beautiful, but it's also unaltruistic, hidden from external feedback, a magnet for obsession, and probably futile in the limit. I want to still be able to care about the world at large, to be curious about *real things*, and to play some of society's grander games.
