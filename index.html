            <p>Hi, I'm Christine Ye. I'm a current student at Stanford University, where I study Mathematics and Physics, dance with Cardinal Ballet Company, design for FashionX, and spent a quarter living in Berlin. I'm originally from just outside Seattle, Washington.
              I'm currently interested in: evaluations, automated science, AGI policy, the anthropology of progress, skiing, and house music; see my <a href="work.html">research</a> and <a href="blog.html">writing</a>.</p>

              <p> I'm currently part of the NLP Group at Stanford. Last year I worked on retrieval, human evaluations, and embedding interpretability with <a href = "https://jwuphysics.github.io/">John Wu</a>. 
              Previously, I worked on Type Ia supernova cosmology and optical/IR observations with <a href = "https://djones.sites.ucsc.edu/student-projects/">David Jones</a> at <a href = "https://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini</a> Hawaii.
              From 2020 to 2022 I studied astrophysics and cosmology with gravitational-wave populations with <a href = "https://mayafishbach.me/">Maya Fishbach</a> and <a href = "https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO</a>, and was fortunate enough to be awarded the <a href = "https://www.societyforscience.org/blog/five-questions-with-christine-ye-the-1st-place-winner-of-the-2022-regeneron-science-talent-search/">top prize</a> in the Regeneron Science Talent Search.</p>

              <p> You can find me via email at cye [at] stanford [dot] edu.</p>
