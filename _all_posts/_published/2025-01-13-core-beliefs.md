*work in progress!*

*on the world*
- people are good, people can be made more good, but society should be structured against collective bad behavior
- the world is created by the conviction of individuals; the world belongs to the ones who care
- everyone should just have more fun
- we underrate how much modern-day stability and prosperity is a product of hegemony

*on my life*
- intentional "accumulation of experiences" is core to living a rich life
- free will is the most useful cognitively dissonant abstraction[^1]; more broadly, you should maintain your *motivation stack*: a set of beliefs, perhaps unfounded/irrational, that do the heavy lifting of steering towards the person you want to be
- to be "interesting", creative, grounded, etc. nurture your inner world and inner weird
- intentionally go against your intuitions sometimes, just to check for self-deception

*miscellaneous*
- I love to coin and mutate of n-grams, with lifespans from ~hours to ~months
