If you're too early in your career to have real, detailed signal, how do you know you're doing "well"? These are *not* the answer:

- (1) *Having the most novel ideas*. It sucks to be "scooped" or to find out someone's already tried your idea, but I think it's good to reframe this as being on the right track, especially if you're new to a field. Important discoveries (calculus, the expanding universe, etc.) are often made in parallel. Your really novel ideas might be breakthroughs, but they also might be blindspots in your understanding or taste (if the idea is actually just uninteresting). 
- (2) *Being the youngest in a room*. I think if you started your work at a young age, or are used to being "precocious", it's easy to keep optimizing for being the youngest person in a given meeting, conference, or group. Then you can keep feeling like some prodigy, and you can chalk up everything else to inexperience and naivete. But you also have to graduate from being *good for your age* to just *good*.
- (3) *Being the only woman in the room*. My friends and I often wonder why the cruelest managers, interviewers, or teammates we encounter tend to be fellow women. My guess is that, especially in older generations, high-achieving women get very used to being the only women in rooms full of men; they might learn that other women represent competition, or even that male-dominated spaces are implicitly spaces of higher achievement. 
- (4) *Easy confirmation*. It's so easy to subconsciously avoid experiments or papers that go against your line of work or current project, even if you have ~relatively little attachment to it. In the name of strengthening my ideas, I'm working on more actively seeking out negative feedback.
