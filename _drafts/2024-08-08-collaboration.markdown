The following observations motivated this post:
- I saw a Tweet in which someone claimed that intellectual property couldn't be a moat, because all of SpaceX's designs were public. For various reasons that Tweet was deeply incorrect (and has since been deleted), but the point still stands: even if you had access to every single design spec of SpaceX's rockets, it would still be a Herculean task to copy SpaceX from scratch.
- While working together over the summer, Charlie and I made multiple dumb mistakes that were only due to insufficient communication. As we joked, they wouldn't have happened if we were one brain.
- In my (limited) experience, very few teams have been more productive than focused effort by myself.
